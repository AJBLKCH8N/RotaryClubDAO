#Smart Contract Folder
the DAO.SOl smart contract allows for token holders (NFT Holders) to create and vote on submitted proposals.
This version is based on the project tutorial by MoralisWeb3.

This project utilises the Moralis Web3 suite and Web3API to integrate the front end to the Polygon chain. 

Future Releases:
a. To apply use case to real world application of the Rotary Club and its members:
    1. Create a Rotary Club NFT that allows specified Club Owners with access control to mint new tokens, allocate to addresses (i.e club members), and to destroy tokens (when a member leaves the club).
    2. Modify DAO contract to change ownership structure so in line with required rules and logic
    3. Modify front end to cater for Rotary Club use case.
b. Add functionality for the Home.js to include the Forum and Documentation pages
c. Refactor code to decouple the project from Moralis Web3 APIs to an alternative.
d. Rebuild project and refactor contracts where possible to allow for deployment on Solana
